# NMKR-Prisma Integration Verification Checklist

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: CustomProperties Foundation

### âœ… Schema & Validation
- [ ] CustomPropsV1 interface correctly defined with all required fields
- [ ] buildCustomProps() creates valid JSON with propsVersion=1
- [ ] parseCustomProps() validates and parses JSON correctly
- [ ] Invalid JSON handling returns proper error messages
- [ ] Missing propsVersion handling
- [ ] Type safety for all optional fields

### âœ… NMKR Client Integration
- [ ] getPaymentAddressForSpecificNftSaleWithCustomProps() uses buildCustomProps
- [ ] getPaymentAddressForRandomNftSaleWithCustomProps() logs but doesn't send customProps
- [ ] All NMKR client calls go through customProperties builders
- [ ] No direct JSON string construction in client code

### âœ… Webhook Processing
- [ ] Webhook handler validates customProperty at entry point
- [ ] Invalid customProperty returns 400 with proper error
- [ ] Missing customProperty handled gracefully
- [ ] Missing nftMintId in customProperty handled gracefully

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: State Transition Management

### âœ… Rank-Based Transitions
- [ ] NftMintStatusRank correctly defined (QUEUED:0, SUBMITTED:1, MINTED:2, FAILED:2)
- [ ] canTransitionTo() enforces forward-only progression
- [ ] shouldUpdateMint() prevents stale events
- [ ] txHash preservation (don't overwrite with null)
- [ ] Terminal states (MINTED/FAILED) cannot be overwritten

### âœ… Webhook State Processing
- [ ] NMKR state mapping (confirmedâ†’SUBMITTED, finishedâ†’MINTED, canceled/expiredâ†’FAILED)
- [ ] Stale events are skipped with proper logging
- [ ] State transitions are atomic within transactions
- [ ] Error handling for unknown NMKR states

### âœ… Database Consistency
- [ ] Conditional updates based on rank comparison
- [ ] Transaction rollback on failure
- [ ] Proper error logging with correlation IDs

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Inventory Transfer Logic

### âœ… Inventory Calculation Service
- [ ] calculateInventory() returns correct InventorySnapshot
- [ ] Reserved count (PENDING orders)
- [ ] SoldPendingMint count (PAID orders with SUBMITTED mints)
- [ ] Minted count (orders with MINTED mints)
- [ ] Available calculation (maxSupply - reserved - soldPendingMint - minted)
- [ ] Handles products with no maxSupply

### âœ… State Transition Triggers
- [ ] ON_PAID transition (QUEUEDâ†’SUBMITTED) triggers inventory recalculation
- [ ] ON_MINTED transition (SUBMITTEDâ†’MINTED) triggers inventory recalculation
- [ ] Inventory snapshots logged with proper correlation IDs
- [ ] Transaction consistency for state + inventory updates

### âœ… Edge Cases
- [ ] Concurrent state transitions handled properly
- [ ] Negative available inventory handled gracefully
- [ ] Missing product records handled
- [ ] Missing order/orderItem records handled

## ðŸ“‹ Security & Development Features

### âœ… HMAC Verification
- [ ] HMAC bypass works in development (NODE_ENV !== 'production')
- [ ] HMAC verification works in production mode
- [ ] Invalid signatures rejected with 401
- [ ] Missing signatures handled appropriately
- [ ] Timing-safe comparison used

### âœ… Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] All errors logged with proper context
- [ ] Correlation IDs used consistently (nftMintId)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Proper error responses to webhook calls
- [ ] Graceful degradation on service failures

## ðŸ“‹ Integration & End-to-End

### âœ… Full Webhook Flow
- [ ] Payment confirmed â†’ SUBMITTED state â†’ inventory transfer
- [ ] Minting finished â†’ MINTED state â†’ inventory transfer
- [ ] Failed payments â†’ FAILED state (no inventory impact)
- [ ] Duplicate/stale events ignored properly

### âœ… Service Dependencies
- [ ] All services registered in DI container
- [ ] Proper dependency injection working
- [ ] Service resolution without circular dependencies
- [ ] Mock context creation for webhook processing

### âœ… TypeScript & Build
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All imports resolved correctly
- [ ] Generated types working properly
- [ ] No runtime type errors

## ðŸ“‹ Performance & Scalability

### âœ… Database Performance
- [ ] Inventory calculations use efficient aggregations
- [ ] Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- [ ] Transaction scope minimized
- [ ] No N+1 query problems

### âœ… Error Recovery
- [ ] Webhook processing is idempotent
- [ ] Failed webhooks can be retried safely
- [ ] Partial failures don't corrupt state
- [ ] Proper cleanup on transaction rollback

## ðŸ“‹ Local Testing Scenarios

### âœ… Happy Path
- [ ] Create order â†’ Payment confirmed â†’ Mint finished
- [ ] Inventory counts update correctly at each step
- [ ] All logs contain proper correlation IDs

### âœ… Error Scenarios
- [ ] Invalid webhook payloads
- [ ] Missing database records
- [ ] Network failures during processing
- [ ] Concurrent webhook processing

### âœ… Edge Cases
- [ ] Out-of-order webhook delivery
- [ ] Duplicate webhook delivery
- [ ] Webhook delivery after long delays
- [ ] Malformed customProperty data
